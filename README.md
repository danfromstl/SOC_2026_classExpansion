## SOC 2018 detailed occupation lookup

Use `scripts/lookup_soc_2018.py` to resolve a detailed occupation code such as `15-1251` to its title.

Examples:

```bash
python scripts/lookup_soc_2018.py 15-1251
python scripts/lookup_soc_2018.py
python scripts/lookup_soc_2018.py --refresh 15-1251
```

The script reads `sourceDocs/soc_structure_2018.xlsx`, extracts the detailed occupation rows, and writes a JSON cache to `scripts/soc_2018_detailed_occupations.json` the first time it runs.
